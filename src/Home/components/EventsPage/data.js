					"Prof. David Jeffrey Wineland, is an American Nobel-laureate physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Physics laboratory. His work included advances in optics, specifically laser-cooling trapped ions and using ions for quantum- computing operations. He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics, jointly with Prof. Serge Haroche, for 'ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems'. Prof. Wineland was born in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin on February 24, 1944. Prof. Wineland graduated from Encina High School in Sacramento in 1961. He received his bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1965 and his master's and doctoral degrees in Physics from Harvard University. He completed his PhD in 1970, supervised by Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr. He then performed postdoctoral research in Hans Dehmelt's group at the University of Washington where he investigated electrons in ion traps. In January 2018, Prof. Wineland moved to the Department of Physics University of Oregon as a Knight Research Professor, while still being engaged with the Ion Storage Group at NIST in a consulting role. His NIST group uses trapped ions in many experiments on fundamental Physics, and quantum state control. They have demonstrated optical techniques to prepare ground, superposition and entangled states. This work has led to advances in spectroscopy, atomic clocks and quantum information. In 1995, he created the first single atom quantum logic gate and was the first to quantum teleport information in massive particles in 2004. Prof. Wineland implemented the most precise",

After that he received his physics doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1978 he joined NIST. In 1996, he received the Albert A. Michelson Medal from The Franklin. Prof. Phillips doctoral thesis concerned the magnetic moment of the proton in H 2 O. He later did some work with Bose–Einstein condensates. In 1997, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Prof. Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and Prof. Steven Chu for his contributions to laser cooling, a technique to slow the movement of gaseous atoms in order to better study them, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and especially for his invention of the Zeeman slower. Prof. Phillips is also a Professor of Physics, at University of Maryland, College Park.",

He taught at various universities world-wide as a Fulbright scholar, Erskine fellow, or as a visiting professor. He won several academic and technical awards and grants. He has published over 160 applied research papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings of repute. He has supervised over 250 undergraduate/graduate and research student theses, reviewed several technical articles, papers, textbooks and research proposals for various domestic and international conferences, journals, scientific bodies and publishers",

			"Automotive industry traditionally has reduced weight primarily by downsizing. Today, the strategy of downsizing vehicle has reached its limits. The OEMs are also facing substantial increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations in the U.S. and the other global markets. In this context, engineering students need to understand the underlying contributors that significantly play a role in vehicle Light-weighting. One of the main contributors is the appropriate use of a variety of high strength and lightweight materials to meet the mass (weight) targets. Another aspect and a more challenging issue is that a realization of how OEMs are learning to cost effectively join (weld, rivet, form and cast) lightweight (and often multi) materials on a global platform. How to impart these ideas intoa single platform? The purpose of this talk is to discuss the need and strategic development of undergraduate and graduate level coursematerials on this topic and the best assessment techniques to gauge the understanding of the topics by the students. The teaching and learning experiences of the Prof. Raghu in delivering this webinar is related mechanical student and to general technicalaudience.",
