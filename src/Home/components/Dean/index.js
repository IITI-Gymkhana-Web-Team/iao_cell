						<b>IIT Indore</b> has centralized office for
						<b> International Affairs and Outreach</b> to oversee
						and coordinate the relevant activities. We deal with the
						partner Universities across the globe for academic and
						research collaborations, which facilitate opportunities
						to IITI and partner instituteâ€™s students and faculties
						for mobility, research, exchange, and internships. IITI
						is establishing linkage with renowned Universities of
						the world. We have signed several Memorandum of
						Understandings (MoUs) with various Universities /
						Institutions across the globe to promote bilateral
						grants, mobility programs, international fellowships,
						and other MHRD initiatives like{" "}
						<Link to="/mhrd/sparc">SPARC</Link>,{" "}
						<Link to="/mhrd/vajra">VAJRA</Link> and
						<Link to="/mhrd/gian"> GIAN </Link>
						for students and faculties over the last decade.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moreover, our office is contributing more to develop
						strong and sustainable international partnerships with
						research laboratories, academic institutions, industry,
						and entrepreneurs in order to internationalize teaching
						and research activities of the institution.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are exploring various schemes of Government of India
						such as <b>SII</b>, <b>ICCR</b> and <b>ASEAN</b> to
						attract foreign students to continue their higher
						studies at IITI . We aim to facilitate learning,
						personal growth, and cultural understanding through
						active participation by reaching eminent
						institution/organizations across the globe. We have
						expanded more efforts for IITI faculty members and
						students with an aim to explore the internationalization
						of higher education with all the geographical regions of
						the world.
					</p>
					<p>
						COVID-19 has given a new dimension to the world. We have
						a setup of world class facilities / teaching aids for
						conducting online classes / webinars / events for
						international students. In addition, we are also forming
						relations with the Embassies of various countries and
						their Consulates to promote various academic and
						research activities, students exchange, cultural
						exchange and other educational programs.
					</p>
					<p>
						We would be happy to hear from the foreign
						Universities/institutions seeking partnership with IITI,
						or international students seeking opportunities at IITI.
